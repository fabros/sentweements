Final project for [Data Mining](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-2016) course of MSc in Engineering in Computer Science
at Universit√† degli Studi di Roma "La Sapienza" (A.Y. 2016/2017).

## The project
**Sentweements** is a simple sentiment analysis tool for tweets.
This interactive choropleth map allows you to see the Italian **sentimental situation**, using Twitter Streaming API to
fetch tweetsvcoming from Italy in real-time and Indico artificial intelligence to perform a textual sentiment analysis.
Results are presented in real-time on the client side in a beautiful fashion. With **Sentweements** you have:
- national and region-specific statistics, available through mouse hover.
- data persistence implemented with [SQLite DB](https://www.sqlite.org/).
- dynamic updates automatically reflected on the map as new data becomes available (Twitter streaming data).
- static analysis mode available by defining a time window of tweets to analyse, to get many different perspectives.
- api keys **carousel** and **multi-threaded** data retrieval architecture to expand rate limit both for Twitter and sentiments APIs (check [secret_keys_template](
https://github.com/giacomolanciano/sentweements/blob/master-v2/secret_keys_template.txt) for instructions).

See also our images streaming [emotion analysis](https://github.com/giacomolanciano/sentweements).

## Technologies
- [Indico](https://indico.io/) - the artificial intelligence that detect sentiments in texts, available for several different languages.
- [Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview) - to access in real-time to tweets coming from all over the Italy.
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - microframework to build the webserver and serve client requests.
- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) - to build the dynamic visualisation of Italian regions.

## To run
Be sure to have **Python 3** installed. Note that some additional Python modules are required, you can run `dependencies.py`
to install them all in one shot.  
To start tweets retrieval, open a terminal and type `$ python tweets_streaming.py`. Note that you need a working Internet connection to download the tweets from Twitter.  
To run the webapp (locally), open a terminal and type `$ python webapp.py`. Then, open a browser and go to
**localhost:5000**.
